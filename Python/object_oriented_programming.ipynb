    "**im still confused, doesnt a setter change the attribute anyways?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You're absolutely right to be confused! It's a subtle but crucial point. Yes, a setter *does* change the attribute.  But the way it changes it, and the control it provides, is what makes it different and *better* than directly assigning to a public attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate with an analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a valuable object (your data, like `_birthday`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Public Attribute (Direct Access):**  It's like leaving the object out in the open. Anyone can come along and change it, even accidentally or inappropriately (like changing its type or setting it to an invalid value). You have no record of who changed it or when.\n",
    "*   **Setter Method:** It's like having a secure box for the object.  To change the object, you have to go through a specific process:\n",
    "    1.  You hand the new version of the object (the new birthday value) to a designated person (the setter method).\n",
    "    2.  The designated person (the setter) can then:\n",
    "        *   Check if the new object is valid (e.g., correct date format).\n",
    "        *   Record who made the change and when (you could add logging).\n",
    "        *   Perform any necessary conversions or adjustments before placing the new object in the box (e.g., convert the string to a `datetime` object).\n",
    "    3.  Finally, they replace the old object with the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences and Why Setters Are Better:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Validation:** The setter can *validate* the new value *before* it's assigned to the attribute.  This prevents errors and ensures data integrity.  Direct assignment to a public attribute bypasses this validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Abstraction:** The setter *hides the internal details* of how the data is stored.  You can change how `_birthday` is stored (e.g., from a string to a `datetime` object) *without* affecting the code that uses the setter.  With direct access, you'd have to change every piece of code that touches the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Control:** The setter gives you *control* over when and how the attribute is changed.  You can add logging, security checks, or other logic to the setter.  Direct assignment provides no such control.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Maintainability:**  If you need to change how the attribute is handled, you only need to change the setter (and getter, if necessary).  With direct access, you'd have to find and modify *every instance* where the attribute is used."
