    "**im still confused, doesnt a setter change the attribute anyways?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You're absolutely right to be confused! It's a subtle but crucial point. Yes, a setter *does* change the attribute.  But the way it changes it, and the control it provides, is what makes it different and *better* than directly assigning to a public attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate with an analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a valuable object (your data, like `_birthday`).\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Public Attribute (Direct Access):**  It's like leaving the object out in the open. Anyone can come along and change it, even accidentally or inappropriately (like changing its type or setting it to an invalid value). You have no record of who changed it or when.\n",
    "*   **Setter Method:** It's like having a secure box for the object.  To change the object, you have to go through a specific process:\n",
    "    1.  You hand the new version of the object (the new birthday value) to a designated person (the setter method).\n",
    "    2.  The designated person (the setter) can then:\n",
    "        *   Check if the new object is valid (e.g., correct date format).\n",
    "        *   Record who made the change and when (you could add logging).\n",
    "        *   Perform any necessary conversions or adjustments before placing the new object in the box (e.g., convert the string to a `datetime` object).\n",
    "    3.  Finally, they replace the old object with the new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences and Why Setters Are Better:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Validation:** The setter can *validate* the new value *before* it's assigned to the attribute.  This prevents errors and ensures data integrity.  Direct assignment to a public attribute bypasses this validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Abstraction:** The setter *hides the internal details* of how the data is stored.  You can change how `_birthday` is stored (e.g., from a string to a `datetime` object) *without* affecting the code that uses the setter.  With direct access, you'd have to change every piece of code that touches the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Control:** The setter gives you *control* over when and how the attribute is changed.  You can add logging, security checks, or other logic to the setter.  Direct assignment provides no such control.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Maintainability:**  If you need to change how the attribute is handled, you only need to change the setter (and getter, if necessary).  With direct access, you'd have to find and modify *every instance* where the attribute is used."

    "**Explanation of Private Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Naming Convention:** Private variables in Python are indicated by a double underscore prefix (`__`).  For example, `__password` is a private variable.\n",
    "*   **Name Mangling:** Python uses a technique called \"name mangling\" to make it a little harder to directly access private variables from outside the class.  When you define `__password`, Python internally renames it to something like `_UserPrivate__password`. This is why `user_private.__password` raises an `AttributeError`.\n",
    "*   **Accessibility:**  The *intent* of private variables is that they should only be accessed and modified from within the class itself.\n",
    "*   **Not Strictly Enforced:**  Python's privacy mechanism is primarily based on convention and name mangling. It's *not* like some other languages (Java, C++) where private variables are *strictly* inaccessible from outside the class.  You *can* still access private variables using name mangling (as shown in the example), but it is strongly discouraged.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Differences Between Protected and Private:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Protected (`_`):**  A *convention*.  Signals that the attribute is intended for internal use within the class and its subclasses.  Direct access is discouraged but possible.\n",
    "*   **Private (`__`):**  A stronger convention combined with name mangling.  Intended for use *only* within the class.  Direct access is made more difficult but is still technically possible (though very bad practice).\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use Private Variables:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Private variables are typically used for things that should be completely hidden from the outside world and *not even accessible by subclasses*:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Sensitive Data:** Passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information should ideally be stored as private variables.\n",
    "*   **Internal State:**  Variables that represent the internal state of an object and are not meant to be directly manipulated by external code.\n",
    "*   **Implementation Details:**  If you have internal variables that you might need to change in the future, making them private helps to ensure that no other code is relying on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Not Just Use Private for Everything?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with public variables, making everything private would be too restrictive.  Often, you *want* subclasses to have access to certain attributes (hence, protected).  Private variables are for situations where you truly want to encapsulate data and prevent *any* access from outside the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Summary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Private variables are a stronger form of encapsulation than protected variables.\n",
    "*   They are intended for data that should be completely hidden and accessed only within the class.\n",
    "*   Python's privacy mechanism is primarily based on convention and name mangling, not strict enforcement.  Avoid directly accessing mangled names.\n",
    "*   Use private variables sparingly, only when you truly need to hide data.  Protected variables often provide a better balance between encapsulation and accessibility."

    "*   **`check_password(self, entered_password)`:**\n",
    "    *   This method *within* the `UserPrivate` class accesses the private variable `self.__password` directly.  This is the correct way to use a private variable. It's part of the class's internal implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`change_password(self, old_password, new_password)`:**\n",
    "    *   This is a *new* method added to demonstrate modifying the private variable.\n",
    "    *   It first *accesses* `self.__password` indirectly via `self.check_password()` (which is perfectly fine – methods within the class can call each other).\n",
    "    *   If the old password is correct, it *modifies* `self.__password` directly using `self.__password = new_password`.  This is allowed *only* because `change_password` is a method *inside* the `UserPrivate` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`__reset_password(self, new_password)`:**\n",
    "    *   A *private* method added to demonstrate a private variable being accessed within another private method.\n",
    "    *  It resets the `self.__password` variable.\n",
    "    *   It prints that the password has been reset.\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Demonstration of `change_password`:**\n",
    "    *   The code outside the class now uses `user_private.change_password()` to attempt password changes.  It *cannot* directly access or modify `__password`. It must go through the provided method.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Demonstration of private method call, outside of the class**\n",
    "    *   Attempts to use the private `__reset_password` method through `user_private.__reset_password(\"new_secret\")`, and it properly errors out.\n",
    "    *   Uses mangling to access the `__reset_password` variable, through `user_private._UserPrivate__reset_password(\"new_password_2\")`.\n",
    "    * It prints the value returned by check password, with the \"new_password_2\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This revised example clearly shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   Private variables are accessed and modified using `self` *within* the class's methods.\n",
    "*   External code (outside the class) should *not* directly access or modify private variables. It should use the provided public methods (like `check_password` and `change_password` in this case) to interact with the object's internal state.\n",
    "* Private methods can access and modify the private variables with `self`, just like any other method within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This adheres to the principles of encapsulation and data hiding, making your code more robust, maintainable, and secure."

    "\"Accessed only internally\" in the context of the `__reset_password` method means that this method is intended to be called *only* from *within* other methods of the `UserPrivate` class itself, and *not* from outside the class.  It's an implementation detail hidden from the external world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a breakdown of what that implies and why it's important:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Not Part of the Public Interface:** The double underscore prefix (`__`) signifies that `__reset_password` is a *private* method.  This is a strong convention in Python indicating that it's not part of the class's public API (Application Programming Interface).  The public API is the set of methods and attributes that external code is *intended* to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Encapsulation:**  \"Accessed only internally\" is a core concept of encapsulation.  The `__reset_password` method likely performs a specific, low-level operation related to password management that is *not* meant to be directly controlled by external code.  By making it private, you prevent external code from:\n",
    "\n",
    "    *   Calling it directly and potentially bypassing important security checks or other logic (like the password validation in `change_password`).\n",
    "    *   Becoming dependent on the internal implementation details of `__reset_password`.  If you later decide to change how password resets work (maybe you add logging, or interact with a database), you only need to modify `__reset_password` itself.  External code won't break because it wasn't directly calling this internal method.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **How it *could* be used internally (Example):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Imagine you wanted to add a \"forgot password\" feature to your `UserPrivate` class. You might have a public method like this:"

    "*   `_check_security_answer` is a *protected* method. Intended to be used within the class and subclasses.\n",
    "*   Inside `forgot_password`, *if* the security question is answered correctly, *then* it calls `self.__reset_password(new_password)`. This is an *internal* call, from one method within the class to another private method within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, the external code interacts with the `forgot_password` method, which handles the security check, and *only then*, if appropriate, uses the internal `__reset_password` method to actually change the password.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Name Mangling:** As we've discussed, Python uses name mangling.  `__reset_password` is internally renamed to `_UserPrivate__reset_password`. This makes it *harder* (but not impossible) for external code to accidentally or intentionally call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Convention, Not Enforcement:**  It's important to reiterate that Python's privacy is based on convention and name mangling.  It's *not* strict enforcement like in Java or C++.  You *could* technically call `user_private._UserPrivate__reset_password(\"new_password\")` from outside the class, but this would be a *very bad practice* because it violates encapsulation and makes your code fragile.\n",

    "**In summary,** \"accessed only internally\" means the method is designed to be used only by other methods *within the same class*.  It's part of the class's internal workings, not its public interface.  This promotes encapsulation, maintainability, and security. You use `self` to call it from within other methods of the class. You should *never* call it directly from outside the class."
